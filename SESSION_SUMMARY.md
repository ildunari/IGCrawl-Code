# Instagram Intelligence Dashboard v2 - Continued Session Summary

## Summary of Work Completed

### Initial Request
Continue implementing Instagram Intelligence Dashboard v2 from a previous conversation that ran out of context, focusing on:
- Adding user-friendly explanations to proxy configuration and rate limiting settings
- Implementing automatic encryption without exposing keys to users
- Fixing current errors (429 CORS issues, missing placeholder avatar, stuck scrape initialization)
- Adding cancel functionality for mid-scrape with option to save or delete partial data
- Implementing BrightData SSL certificate using port 33335

### Completed Work

1. **Settings Page Improvements**
   - Added expandable proxy information sections
   - Implemented better rate limiting explanations
   - Added automatic encryption for proxy credentials
   - Fixed various UI issues

2. **Rate Limiter Enhancements**
   - Modified `/backend/app/utils/rate_limiter.py` to skip OPTIONS requests:
   ```python
   if scope["method"] == "OPTIONS":
       await self.app(scope, receive, send)
       return
   ```

3. **Cancel Functionality Implementation**
   - Added new statuses to `/backend/app/models/scrape.py`: CANCELLED and PARTIAL
   - Added fields for partial progress tracking:
   ```python
   followers_scraped: Optional[int] = None
   following_scraped: Optional[int] = None
   is_partial: bool = Field(default=False)
   ```
   - Created cancel endpoint in `/backend/app/api/scrapes.py`:
   ```python
   @router.post("/{scrape_id}/cancel", response_model=ScrapeResponse)
   async def cancel_scrape(scrape_id: int, save_partial: bool = True, ...):
   ```

4. **Dialog Component Fixes**
   - Created `/frontend/src/components/CancelScrapeDialog.tsx`
   - Fixed aria-describedby warnings in Dialog components

5. **Proxy Configuration**
   - Added to `/backend/app/config.py`:
   ```python
   use_proxy: bool = False
   proxy_host: str = "brd.superproxy.io"
   proxy_port: int = 33335  # New BrightData port
   proxy_username: Optional[str] = None
   proxy_password: Optional[str] = None
   proxy_ssl_cert_path: str = "ssl/brightdata_proxy_ca/..."
   ```

## Issues Still Remaining

### 1. CORS Error with Rate Limiting (Primary Issue)
**What's happening:** When the rate limiter returns a 429 error, it doesn't include CORS headers, causing the browser to block the request.

**Error message:** "Access to XMLHttpRequest... has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."

### 2. Placeholder Avatar 404 Error
**What's happening:** The placeholder avatar file exists at `/frontend/public/placeholder-avatar.png` but returns 404 when accessed.

## Why These Issues Remain

### CORS Issue
FastAPI middleware executes in reverse order of registration:
1. RateLimitMiddleware is added second but runs first
2. CORSMiddleware is added first but runs second
3. When rate limiting returns 429, it bypasses CORS entirely

Current middleware order in `/backend/app/main.py`:
```python
# Rate limiting middleware (runs first despite being added second)
app.add_middleware(RateLimitMiddleware, rate_limiter=rate_limiter)

# CORS middleware (runs second despite being added first)
app.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, ...)
```

### Avatar Issue
Likely a static file serving configuration problem - file exists but frontend can't access it.

## Instructions to Identify and Prove the Issues

### For CORS Issue:
1. Open browser Developer Tools > Network tab
2. Make multiple requests to trigger rate limiting
3. When you see a 429 response, check its headers
4. Confirm missing `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header
5. Check console for CORS error messages

### For Avatar Issue:
1. Navigate to the Accounts page
2. Open Developer Tools > Network tab
3. Look for `placeholder-avatar.png` request
4. Confirm it returns 404
5. Verify file exists at `/frontend/public/placeholder-avatar.png`

## Directions for Resolution

### Using Reasoner and Sequential Thinking to Fix CORS Issue

1. **Analyze FastAPI Middleware Architecture**
   - Use Reasoner to understand middleware execution flow
   - Map out the request/response lifecycle
   - Identify where CORS headers should be added

2. **Consider Alternative Approaches**
   - Option A: Create custom middleware that combines rate limiting and CORS
   - Option B: Modify rate limiter to include CORS headers in responses
   - Option C: Use FastAPI's exception handlers for consistent CORS
   - Option D: Implement CORS at a different layer (e.g., nginx)

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Start with least invasive solution
   - Test each approach systematically
   - Ensure no new issues are introduced
   - Verify CORS headers on all response types (200, 429, 500, etc.)

### For Avatar Issue

1. **Static File Configuration**
   - Check Docker volume mounting for frontend assets
   - Verify Vite's public directory configuration
   - Ensure proper path resolution in production vs development

2. **Alternative Solutions**
   - Move avatar to src/assets and import it
   - Use base64 encoded avatar in CSS
   - Serve from backend API endpoint

## Key Technical Stack

- Docker containerization with docker-compose
- FastAPI backend with SQLModel ORM
- React frontend with Vite, TailwindCSS, and Radix UI
- Redis + RQ for background job processing
- Instagram scraping with instagrapi library
- BrightData proxy with SSL certificate (port 33335)

## Next Priority Actions

1. Fix CORS issue to ensure all responses include proper headers
2. Resolve placeholder avatar serving issue
3. Test complete cancel/partial save workflow
4. Verify proxy functionality with BrightData SSL
