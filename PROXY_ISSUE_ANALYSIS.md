# IGCrawl BrightData Proxy Authentication Issue - Detailed Analysis

## Executive Summary
The IGCrawl application is experiencing a critical proxy authentication issue with BrightData that prevents successful Instagram scraping. Despite the proxy credentials appearing correct and the application completing scrapes, the actual Instagram data is not being retrieved, resulting in 0 followers and 0 following counts when the actual account has 336 followers and 342 following.

## Current Configuration

### BrightData Proxy Credentials
- **Host**: `brd.superproxy.io`
- **Port**: `33335`
- **Username**: `brd-customer-hl_8d3663f1-zone-ig_crawl_center`
- **Password**: `9lvviuxub033` (recently corrected from `9lvvluxub033`)
- **SSL Certificate Path**: `ssl/brightdata_cert_bundle/brightdata_proxy_ca 2/New SSL certifcate - MUST BE USED WITH PORT 33335/BrightData SSL certificate (port 33335).crt`

### Instagram Credentials
- **Username**: `TransatlanticFrames`
- **Password**: `F3EH.NtT@twpcqc`

### Environment Configuration (.env file)
```env
# Instagram credentials
INSTAGRAM_USERNAME=TransatlanticFrames
INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD=F3EH.NtT@twpcqc

# Proxy Configuration (BrightData)
USE_PROXY=true
PROXY_HOST=brd.superproxy.io
PROXY_PORT=33335
PROXY_USERNAME=brd-customer-hl_8d3663f1-zone-ig_crawl_center
PROXY_PASSWORD=9lvviuxub033
PROXY_SSL_CERT_PATH=ssl/brightdata_cert_bundle/brightdata_proxy_ca 2/New SSL certifcate - MUST BE USED WITH PORT 33335/BrightData SSL certificate (port 33335).crt

# Rate limiting (more relaxed for development)
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=10
SCRAPE_DELAY_SECONDS=5
```

## The Core Issue

### Symptom
- When scraping Instagram user `vitamintk`, the application returns:
  - 0 followers
  - 0 following
- The actual Instagram profile shows:
  - 336 followers
  - 342 following
  - 100 posts

### Worker Logs Analysis
From the Docker worker logs, we see recurring authentication failures:
```
worker-1  | Error getting user ID: 407 Auth failed
worker-1  | Failed to initialize private client: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
worker-1  | Instagrapi scraper failed: ProxyError HTTPSConnectionPool(host='i.instagram.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /api/v1/users/vitamintk/usernameinfo/ (Caused by ProxyError('Unable to connect to proxy', OSError('Tunnel connection failed: 407 Auth failed')))
```

### HTTP 407 Error
The 407 error indicates "Proxy Authentication Required". BrightData is rejecting our authentication with the message:
```
x-brd-err-msg: Invalid authentication: check credentials and retry. Bright Data credentials include your account ID, zone name and password
```

## Timeline of Events and Attempted Fixes

### 1. Initial Discovery
- Proxy was returning 407 Auth failed errors when attempting to scrape Instagram
- Error message indicated invalid authentication credentials

### 2. Password Fix (Partially Successful)
- Claude Desktop identified a typo in the password
- Changed from `9lvvluxub033` (with "lux") to `9lvviuxub033` (with "viu")
- After this fix, scrapes started completing without throwing errors
- However, the data returned is still empty (0 followers, 0 following)

### 3. Certificate Path Verification
- Verified SSL certificate exists at the specified path
- Certificate is specifically for port 33335 as required

### 4. Current State
- Scrapes complete successfully according to the application
- No visible proxy errors in logs
- But the actual Instagram data is not being retrieved
- The scraper appears to be failing silently

## Code Structure Analysis Needed

### Key Files to Examine

1. `/backend/app/scrapers/graphql_scraper.py`
   - Handles GraphQL-based Instagram scraping
   - Should contain proxy configuration logic

2. `/backend/app/scrapers/instagram_scraper.py`
   - Handles Instagram private API scraping
   - Should contain proxy configuration logic

3. `/backend/app/utils/proxy_config.py`
   - Centralized proxy configuration
   - Contains functions `get_proxy_config()` and `configure_instagrapi_proxy()`

4. `/backend/app/workers/tasks.py`
   - Background task execution
   - Where scraping is initiated

5. `/backend/app/worker_wrapper.py`
   - Wrapper for worker tasks
   - Handles scrape execution

## Test Results

### Direct Proxy Test
```bash
curl -i --proxy brd.superproxy.io:33335 \
     --proxy-user brd-customer-hl_8d3663f1-zone-ig_crawl_center:9lvviuxub033 \
     --cacert "path/to/certificate.crt" \
     "https://geo.brdtest.com/welcome.txt"
```
Result: 407 Auth failed

### Scrape API Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/scrapes/ \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"account_id": 1, "scrape_type": "both", "use_private": true}'
```
Result: Scrape completes but returns 0 followers/following

## Network Traffic Analysis
- Browser tools show normal API communication between frontend and backend
- GET /api/v1/accounts returns the account data
- Scrape progress API shows the scrape stuck at 25% for extended periods
- Eventually completes but with empty data

## Console Logs
- No JavaScript errors in browser console
- Only warning about missing Description for DialogContent

## Areas Requiring Investigation

1. **Silent Failures**: Why is the scraper not throwing errors when it can't retrieve data?
2. **Proxy Integration**: Is the proxy configuration being properly applied to all HTTP requests?
3. **SSL Certificate**: Is the certificate being loaded and used correctly?
4. **Error Handling**: Are proxy errors being caught and suppressed somewhere in the code?
5. **Request Headers**: Are all required headers being sent for BrightData authentication?

## Questions for AI Agent Analysis

1. Where in the code path might proxy authentication errors be getting suppressed?
2. Is the proxy configuration being applied to both HTTPX and Instagrapi clients correctly?
3. Could there be a disconnect between the proxy configuration and the actual HTTP requests?
4. Why would a scrape complete "successfully" but return empty data?
5. Are there additional HTTP headers or authentication methods BrightData might require?
6. Is there a test endpoint we can use to verify proxy connectivity before attempting Instagram scraping?

## Additional Context
- The application uses Docker containers for all services
- Redis is used for job queuing
- FastAPI backend with React frontend
- Both GraphQL and private Instagram API approaches are implemented
- Rate limiting is configured but might not be the issue since we get immediate auth failures

## Request for AI Agent
Please analyze the code structure, particularly focusing on:
1. How proxy authentication is implemented
2. Where errors might be getting suppressed
3. Why scrapes complete but return empty data
4. Potential fixes for the BrightData authentication issue

The goal is to successfully scrape Instagram profiles through the BrightData proxy and retrieve accurate follower/following counts.
